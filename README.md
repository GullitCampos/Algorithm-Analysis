 Algorithm Analysis is a fundamental discipline in the computer science course.

Work Description 1 â€“ Application of Divide-and-Conquer

Objective: Compare conventional and divide-and-conquer algorithms implemented for a specific problem.

Instructions: The group must select a problem (not covered in class) where the divide-and-conquer technique can be applied.
Implement, in a programming language chosen by the group, a conventional algorithm (generally based on a direct definition, not using a specific technique, or providing an immediate solution) and an algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique.

Conduct experiments using significant instances (large enough for the problem) and measure execution times. Compare the execution times of the algorithms using tables or graphs.
Prepare a presentation including a description of the problem, algorithm specifications, algorithm analysis, a table comparing execution times, and a conclusion regarding the comparison.

Notes: Some problems may have a second, improved version of the divide-and-conquer algorithm (with even better execution time). Generally, this second version is a modification of the first. However, implementing a third algorithm is not required. In this case, it is sufficient to present the modification that introduces the improvement, the recurrence relation, and the execution time of this second version.
Examples of problems with such a second version: Integer multiplication and Matrix multiplication.
For problems where only one divide-and-conquer version is found, implementing that version alone is sufficient.
Sorting algorithms (mergesort and quicksort) should not be used.

Problems:

    1- Multiplication of two matrices.]
    
    2- Integer multiplication.
    
    3- Closest pair of points
    
    4- Computing the n-th power of a given base (a^n).
    
    5- Binary search.
    
    6- Convex hull (QuickHull algorithm).
    
    7- Determining the most frequent element.
    
    8- Removing duplicates from a sequence.
